# CoHDI Release Approach
CoHDI will release some artifacts around the work being done in the project. This document details how the artifacts are released, and how it relates to the form the project takes, meaning this document is the result of a mailing list discussion around the CoHDI release process.

# Release Cadence
The CoHDI Project will strive to release code on a cadence of once every 6 months.

# Concrete CoHDI  Release Approach
CoHDI  will be releasing a set of artifacts, including an example architecture and integration platform. The example architecture and integration platform are not meant to be used in production.
