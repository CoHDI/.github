## CoHDI Project
The objective is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks built on Composable Hardware Disaggregated Infrastructure ([CoDHI](https://github.com/CoHDI/.github/blob/main/README.md) ), pronounced "Cody"), also known as Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure.  
CoHDI enables data center operators to realize the benefits of cost efficiency, high availability, and sustainability through a disaggregated computing system.
However, a gap still exists between Kubernetes and CoDHI, making it challenging to achieve more dynamic composability within the Kubernetes cloud-native environment.
The DDS project and Composable Resource Operator project aim to bridge this gap by collaborating with the Dynamic Resource Allocation in Node, Autoscaler, and Scheduler projects.
