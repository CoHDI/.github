## CoHDI Project
The objective is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks built on Composable Hardware Disaggregated Infrastructure (CoHDI, pronounced "Cody"), also known as Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure.
CoHDI enables data center operators to realize the benefits of cost efficiency, high availability, and sustainability through a disaggregated computing system.
However, a gap still exists between Kubernetes and CoDHI, making it challenging to achieve more dynamic composability within the Kubernetes cloud-native environment.
The DDS project and Composable Resource Operator project aim to bridge this gap by collaborating with the Dynamic Resource Allocation in Node, Autoscaler, and Scheduler projects.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
